ExTerra
=============
A William Webb &amp; Alex Blandin 4X Space Game
-------------
Part of the Swansea University Game Jam (2017).

Written in [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org) and inspired by [Aurora](http://aurora2.pentarch.org), ExTerra is our idea for a space 4X in which details matter &mdash; but where you can use the mouse-wheel and other 21st century goodies.

On the technical side, the game is implemented mostly through an [Immediate Mode GUI](https://mollyrocket.com/861), and this "Immediate Mode Interface" philosophy permeates the entire project.
